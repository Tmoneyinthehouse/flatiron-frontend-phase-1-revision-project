My Revised Flatiron Frontend Phase 1 Project - NBA Player Stats App

This is a simple, single page application that displays information of various NBA stars using JSON data fetched from a server. Each player's information is displayed on a card that includes their name, image, points, assists, and rebounds per game averages. These averages reflect from the 2022-2023 NBA season.

--How to Install--
First, you'll want to fork your own copy of the repository to your local machine. Once you've done that, you'll need to open the project folder in your code editor (VSCode). After that, using Terminal, run 'json-server --watch db.json' to start the server. To view the app, run 'open index.html' in Terminal to open the application in your default web browser.

--Using the Application--
Upon loading, you'll see a collection of ten NBA player cards. Each player has their own image so you'll know exactly who you're viewing. Click the 'Toggle Stats' button on a card to view a player's stats for the 2022-2023 NBA season. Only three stat categories are displayed (points per game average, assist per game average, rebounds per game average).
